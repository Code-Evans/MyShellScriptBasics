# MyShellScriptBasics

A structured learning repository focused on **KornShell (.ksh)** scripting,
emphasizing **script creation**, **design patterns**, and **clean shell
programming practices**.

This repository intentionally avoids system administration tasks
(e.g., permissions, users, services) and focuses purely on **logic,
structure, and maintainability**.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Learn KornShell as a programming language
- Write readable, modular, and reusable scripts
- Apply shell-specific design patterns
- Build production-style scripts using POSIX tools
